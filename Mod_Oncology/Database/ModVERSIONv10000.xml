Update v1.0.0.0
Mod is considered feature complete now that I've reached 80 diagnosis (that's has been more than 400hrs work there!) I'll continue to add more content overtime but it is no longer a priority.

Additions:
Added 1 New Diagnosis Type (Vaginal Cancer)
Added content to existing diagnosis types (Salivary Gland Cancer)
Total of 6 new Diagnosis
NEW CONTENT ONLY - Main Symptoms, Surgery, Samples, Testing and various other icons now have unique icons of their own just to add more flavour.

Changes:
Mod converted to Community Resource Pack (It now requires this mod to function).
Restructured Mod Files & Code (better organised now and helped with the CRP transition).
Added <Tag>ui_ModObjects</Tag> to Oncology Object Tags (Allows other modders to add this tag to equipment to allow it to be placed on my objects such as the cube shelf)
Replaced Biopsy with Ovarian Biopsy for Ovarian Cancers (Makes more sense and makes it harder to guess the diagnosis).
Replaced Fine Needle Aspriation for Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma with Salivary Gland Biopsy (I want to get into a little bit more specific exams and symptoms to avoid the 'stab anywhere, find anything' trend).

Localisation:
Updated Italian Localisation (v0.14.0.1)

Bug Fixes:
Fixed issue with room requipments of Epipen (Should be able to be used anywhere now)
Fixed Dutch Localisation issue with Nerve Compression Surgery
Fixed a bunch of wrong hospitalisation types for certain surgeries
