	<Text>A unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is the surgical removal of one ovary and one fallopian tube, both of which are located on the same side of the body and share a common blood supply (in contrast, a bilateral procedure involves the removal of both ovaries and fallopian tubes). Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy should be considered as the first choice of fertility-sparing treatment for women who wish to preserve fertility. Although the higher risk of local relapses is found, it is not associated with decreased overall survival. \n\nRequired room: Operating room at Oncology dpt.</Text>

	<Text>5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), Cisplatin, and Etoposide (FEP) Combination Treatment. Chemotherapy has relatively poor curative efficacy in certain cancers such as Signet Ring Cell Carcinoma (SRCC) and patients and overall survival rates are lower compared to patients with more typical cancer pathology. These cancers are usually diagnosed during the late stages of the disease, so the tumors generally spread more aggressively than non-signet cancers, making treatment challenging but most active regimens include 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), Cisplatin, and/or Etoposide. FEP combination chemotherapy seems to be an effective treatment regimen for gastric cancer as salvage chemotherapy. \n\nRequired room: Regular Hospitalisation at Oncology dpt.</Text>
