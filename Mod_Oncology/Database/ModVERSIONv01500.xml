(NEW CONTENT ONLY) Main Symptoms, Surgery, Samples, Testing and various other icons now have unique icons of their own.

Changes:
Mod converted to Community Resource Pack (It now requires this mod to function)
Restructured Mod Files & Code (better organised now and helped with the CRP transition)
Added <Tag>ui_ModObjects</Tag> to Oncology Object Tags (Allows other modders to add this tag to equipment to allow it to be placed on my objects such as the cube shelf)

Updated Italian Localisation (v0.14.0.1)
