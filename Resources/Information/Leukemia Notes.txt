TODO:
Need more Chromosomal Detect Icons and Enzyme Markers


CML
CD33 Bright 95, CD13 Bright 83, CD11c Bright 80, CD7 66



M3 Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) 
- Translocation between chromosomes 15 and 17  t(15;17)
- Immunophenotype: Positivity for CD13 and CD33
- Staining: The cells are MPO, SB and chloroacetate esterase (CAE) positive, but generally negative for NSE (NSE positive in 25%).

M4 Acute Myelomonocytic Leukemia
- Translocation t(4;11), t(9;11)
- IMMUNO (CMML)-CD14, CDw65, CD11b, CD33 and HLA-DR
- Staining:More than 20% of the blasts should be MPO + and more than 20% should be NSE +. High serum lysozyme (3x normal) Peripheral monocytosis of > 5x9/L in an otherwise M2 marrow and increased lysozyme and >20% NSE + marrow blasts.

M4e Acute myelomonocytic leukemia with eosinophilia
- M4e variant in which eosinophils(> 5%) are increased in number and abnormal associated with abnormalities of chromosome 16.
- Staining of Variant:CAE, usually negative in eosinophils, is frequently positive in the abnormal eosinophils of M4e.

M5 Acute Monocytic Leukemia
- Diagnosis: BM morphology->30% blasts and >80% cells monocytic
- Chromosome Abnormalities:t(9;11)
- Cell Morphology: Note the nuclear folds and the relatively large nucleoli typical of monoblasts. Strongly NSE+.More than 80% of BM monocytic.

M6 Acute Erythroblastic Leukemia (Rare)
- Maturation: M6 or erythroleukemia is rare and difficult to diagnose. More than 30-50% of the nucleated marrow cells are abnormal nucleated red blood cells.
- Morphology: The leukemic red cells are frequently bizarre with extreme dysplastic featuresincluding giant forms, multinucleation, cytoplasmic vacuolization, cytoplasmic buds, and megaloblastoid changes.
- Staining:MPO -, NSE+. The malignant red cells are PAS positive
- Immunophenotype:Positive for glycophorin A and transferrin receptor.
- Chromosome Abnormalities:del(5q)

Hematopoietic stem cell transplant

acute myeloid leukemia - Markers
Myeloid cells (granulocytes) - MPO (myeloperoxidase), CD11, CD13, CD15, CD16b, CD33, CD66
CD7

Hairy cell leukemia - CD11c, CD103
HCL expressed bright CD20, bright CD22, bright CD11c, bright CD25, CD103, and bright homogeneous CD123(100%).
HCL-v expressed bright CD20, bright CD22, CD11c(100%), CD103(100%), dim(40%) or negative(60%) CD123, and uniformly lacked CD25(100%).

SMZL cases were CD103(-) and CD123(-) except for one case with dim CD123.

Bright, dim and moderate... describe the amount of a particular cell surface protein.

+ is positive...

++ is more positive

- is negative

+/- we don't really know...

When there is a range...they use dim, moderate and bright...

Blood Smear
To evaluate your red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets, to distinguish between the different types of WBCs, and to determine their relative percentages in the blood.
