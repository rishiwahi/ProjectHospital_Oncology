[b][u]What Does This Mod Add?[/u][/b]
- 19 forms of cancer to the game.
- Total of 80 new diagnoses (this mod incorporates multiple stages and sub-types of a single type of cancer)(That's over 500hrs work!)
- New objects (Decorations and Furniture)

The mod also adds many new and relevant forms of treatment, examinations and symptoms, complete with custom icons and descriptions.

[b][u]About this Mod[/u][/b]
Oncology can be complicated and this mod tries to replicate this within the limits of this game. Due to this, it is recommended you have at least a histology lab and a CT or a MRI before building an Oncology department. This mod tries to focus on the many details about each cancer that is added so each diagnosis will average a little longer than others to actually work out. Treatments for oncology will generally require hospitalisation. To help prevent bedlock, Oncology only has a patient weighing of 30 percent (stock departments are 50 percent). This means Oncology will receive less patients overall than other departments.

[b][u]Roadmap:[/u][/b]
This mod is considered feature complete. It will be supported through bug fixes or if broken by game updates.
It will be revamped/redone if there are major game changes. I may occasionally add additional content but it is no longer a priority.

[b][u]Compatibility[/u][/b]
[b]Locked In[/b]
- This mod may be difficult or impossible to remove from an existing save. Please consider starting a new game to see if you enjoy the mod first.

[b]Integrated Compatibility (This mod will utilise these mods if they are installed):[/b]
- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1870852870]Bedside Examinations[/url] by Butch
Please note, Bedside Examinations changes many of the stock examinations, including making Biopsy a hospitalised exam instead of a clinic ordered one. This will make it much more difficult to operate a Oncology Clinic. (15/08/20)

[b][u]Known Issues[/u][/b]
- You may experience longer load times with this mod (starting up the game and loading into a save). This is pretty typical with mods (across all games) especially as they get bigger and if you are subscribed to many. This shouldn't affect performance when you are loaded in though.

Without his help early on, this mod would of been 10x more difficult to develop.
